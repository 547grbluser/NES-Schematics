1-1-1:
    Added note on the operation of the A13 pin and the CHR ROM. Added table
    at bottom with rom sizes. Changed CIC_RST pin on cartridge connector. It
    is supposed to be active high. Working on UNROM cartridge.

1-1-0:
    Modified the A13 and A13_N pins. There was some confusion about the PPU A13
    pin. Some sources said that the A13 pin goes to the enable pin of the ROM, 
    and some said that it went to the enable pin of the VRAM. On the NES
    motherboard, A13 goes to part of a hex inverter chip. This chip, which
    outputs A13_N, goes to pin 58 on the cartridge. Pin 58 is usually jumpered 
    to pin 57 on the cart itself.
